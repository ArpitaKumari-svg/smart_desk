# smart_desk
An IoT-based desk assistant built using ESP8266 that tracks work sessions with IR sensing, ambient light alerts, buzzer feedback, and LED indicators. Sessions auto-start after a short break, and the system alerts the user if the room is too dark. Ideal for productivity tracking in study/work environments.
